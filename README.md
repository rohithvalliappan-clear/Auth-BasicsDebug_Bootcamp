The goal was to identify and fix several issues in an existing codebase:
1.  **Authentication Middleware**: Implemented missing JWT-based authentication on the backend.
2.  **Cart Persistence**: Implemented a real in-memory data store for user carts and added the "Add to Cart" functionality.
3.  **Route Consolidation**: Simplified the backend architecture by consolidating routes into a centralized router.
